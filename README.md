This repository demonstrates a potential issue with date handling in TypeScript. The `greet` function takes a person's name and a date as input, then logs a greeting message.  However, the `Date` object's behavior is affected by the system's time zone. This can lead to different outputs based on the user's location, causing unexpected results, particularly in applications where consistent date handling is critical.  The solution demonstrates how to address this using a more robust approach for consistent date output.
